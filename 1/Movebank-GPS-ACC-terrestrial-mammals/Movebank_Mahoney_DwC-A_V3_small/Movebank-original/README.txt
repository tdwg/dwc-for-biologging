Data Attributes
These definitions come from the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

acceleration X: Acceleration values provided by the tag for the X axis. For acceleration values not in units of m/s^2, use acceleration raw x.
	units: m/s^2

	units: m/s^2

	example: sibling of #1423

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. This identifier can be a ring number, a name, the same as the associated tag ID, etc. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier may sometimes be shown.

deployment end comments: a description of the end of a tag deployment, such as cause of mortality or notes on the removal and/or failure of tag.

dead: The deployment ended with the death of the animal that was carrying the tag.
equipment failure: The tag stopped working.
fall off: The attachment of the tag to the animal failed, and it fell of accidentally.

released: The tag remained on the animal but the animal was released from captivity or confinement.
removal: The tag was purposefully removed from the animal.
unknown: The deployment ended by an unknown cause.

deployment ID: A unique identifier for the deployment of a tag on animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a Deployment ID, an internal Movebank deployment identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: Jane-Tag42

duty cycle: Remarks associated with the duty cycle of a tag during the deployment, describing the times it is on/off and the frequency at which it transmits or records data.
	example: it turns off during the night
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

event ID: An identifier for the set of information associated with each record or event in a data set. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank.

tag technical specification: Values for a tag-specific technical attribute.
	example: 8.31, YES
	units: undefined

THIS DATASET: Values are the dilution of precision (DOP) provided by the GPS.

taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov).
