Data Attributes
These definitions come from the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

acceleration X: Acceleration values provided by the tag for the X axis. For acceleration values not in units of m/s^2, use acceleration raw x.
	units: m/s^2

	units: m/s^2

	example: sibling of #1423

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. This identifier can be a ring number, a name, the same as the associated tag ID, etc. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier may sometimes be shown.

deployment end comments: a description of the end of a tag deployment, such as cause of mortality or notes on the removal and/or failure of tag.

dead: The deployment ended with the death of the animal that was carrying the tag.
equipment failure: The tag stopped working.
fall off: The attachment of the tag to the animal failed, and it fell of accidentally.

released: The tag remained on the animal but the animal was released from captivity or confinement.
removal: The tag was purposefully removed from the animal.
unknown: The deployment ended by an unknown cause.

deployment ID: A unique identifier for the deployment of a tag on animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a Deployment ID, an internal Movebank deployment identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: Jane-Tag42

duty cycle: Remarks associated with the duty cycle of a tag during the deployment, describing the times it is on/off and the frequency at which it transmits or records data.
	example: it turns off during the night
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

event ID: An identifier for the set of information associated with each record or event in a data set. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank.

tag technical specification: Values for a tag-specific technical attribute.
	example: 8.31, YES
	units: undefined

THIS DATASET: Values are the dilution of precision (DOP) provided by the GPS.

taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov). If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy. Additional information can be provided using the term taxon detail.
