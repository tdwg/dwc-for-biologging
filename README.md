# Darwin Core guidelines for biologging data

## Introduction

This repository contains guidelines for expressing biologging data (e.g. acoustic telemetry, GPS tracking) in Darwin Core. It is lead by the Data Standardization Working Group of the [International Bio-Logging Society (IBLS)](https://www.bio-logging.net), in collaboration with IODE/OBIS, which funded [a workshop on animal tagging and tracking, 23-26 April 2018, Oostende, Belgium](http://obis.org/2018/05/18/att/). **The guidelines are a work in progress and not (yet) a TDWG recommendation**.

## Using the Wiki to Map Your Biologging Dataset to Darwin Core

* :notebook_with_decorative_cover: See the [Wiki](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/wiki) section of this repository for [Data](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/wiki/Data-guidelines) and [Metadata guidelines](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/wiki/Metadata-guidelines) as well as use cases that may be organized in a similar way to the biologging dataset you're trying to map to Darwin Core.

    * [Terrestrial mammal GPS and ACC data from Movebank](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/wiki/Terrestrial-mammal-GPS-and-ACC-data-from-Movebank)

* :speech_balloon: If no example case matches closely with what you're trying to do, consider [opening an Issue](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/issues) or contributing your work so far as a new example via a pull request (and a new Wiki entry).
